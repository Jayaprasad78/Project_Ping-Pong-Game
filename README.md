# Ping Pong Game
Hi,im jayaprasad,
Welcome to the Ping Pong game! This is a simplified text-based version of the classic game where you control two rods to bounce a ball back and forth.

## Game Rules

1. Press the 'Enter' key to start a new round.
2. Control both rods using the 'a' and 'd' keys.
3. The losing rod will get the ball for the next match, and the rods and ball will move to the center.
4. The score will be counted from the start of every match.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.
2. Use the 'Enter' key to begin a new round.
3. Use the 'a' and 'd' keys to move both rods horizontally.
4. Try to bounce the ball back and forth to increase your score.

## High Score

1. When the game starts, you will see an alert displaying the highest score and the player who scored it.
2. If this is your first time playing, the alert will indicate "This is your first time."
3. If you achieve a higher score, your name and the new high score will be stored in local storage.

## Customize the Game

Feel free to customize the game by modifying the HTML and CSS in the `index.html` file to change the game's appearance and add additional features.

Have fun playing Ping Pong!

Thank you
